    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This crispy baked chicken recipe is an easy way to have the texture of fried chicken but with baking.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups crushed saltine crackers</li>
        <li>1 tsp seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>&half; cup margarine, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix together crushed crackers, seasoned salt, and garlic powder in a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip chicken breasts into melted margarine, then press into cracker mixture until coated. Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
